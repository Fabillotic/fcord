# fcord
A discord bot implementation in nodejs and python.

To set this up, you need to create a json file called "auth.txt" wich contains the "token" and "user_agent".
Run it by starting the node server. (script.js) Then run the python handler. (fcord.py)
If you want to implement a handler yourself, just listen on "127.0.0.1:2020".
You will receive all of the relevant incoming discord events.
A java runtime environment is needed for the tictactoe game.
